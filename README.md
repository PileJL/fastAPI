Description:
	The API I created serves as a demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a sample user dataset.
    It features endpoints for retrieving all users, fetching a specific user by their ID, adding new users, 
    updating existing user information, and deleting users. This API provides basic functionalities for managing user data, 
    showcasing essential operations that are foundational in many applications.
